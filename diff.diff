-Timetracker
-===========
-
-**timetracker** is ruby script that can be used to keep track of time spent on a task, storing the information in a simple text file.  It doesn't keep track of multiple tasks, it just stores check-in and check-out times, and calculates totals.
-
-A suggested way to use **timetracker** is to set up an alias that includes the path to the file where you want to store your time data, such as:
-
-    alias t='~/timetracker/timetracker.rb ~/files/timesheet'
-
-Features
---------
-
-Assuming the alias described above, the following commands describe the features of **timetracker**:
-
-Check-in:
-
-    ~:$ t
-    2011-05-10     0.0    21:52:16
-
-Check-out:
-
-    ~:$ t
-    2011-05-10     0.1    21:52:16    21:56:48
-
-Check-in again:
-
-    ~:$ t
-    2011-05-10     0.1    21:52:16    21:56:48    21:59:02
-
-Print-out:
-
-    ~:$ t -p
-    2011-05-10     0.1    21:52:16    21:56:48    21:59:02
-
-Display 'quitting time' to tell when you 8 hours are up:
-
-    ~:$ t -q
-    05:54:30
-
-Display 'quitting time' to tell you when half an hour is up:
-
-    ~:$ t -q 0.5
-    22:24:30
-
-Add a message to the current day's time:
-
-    ~:$ t -m "Writing a README"
-    2011-05-10     0.1    21:52:16    21:56:48    21:59:02    Writing a README
-
-Do a 'dry-run' to see how much time you'd have spent if you stop now:
-
-    ~:$ t -d
-    2011-05-10     0.1    21:52:16    21:56:48    21:59:02    22:03:33    Writing a README
-
-And finally, 'repair' the file to recalculate all total times after manually editing the file:
-
-    ~:$ t -r
-
